# Bike Sharing System
> A bike sharing provider BoomBikes in US has recently afficted in their revenues. They have consulted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.The company wants to know :
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands.

## General Information
- A bike-sharing system wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for their shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know :
    - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    - How well those variables describe the bike demands.
- Building Linear Regression Machine Learninf Model for Bike Sharing    System to anylase its demand
- Design a model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. The model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- The Dataset is used for this system is day.csv where 'cnt' is the count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered which is the dependent variable.

## Conclusions
- Temperature is the most important significant feature which affects the Business positively.
- The Demand for the Bikes effect on bad weather condition. So weather affects the Business negatively
- The Demand for Bike on weekends are high than other normal days
- Demand for Bike Rent increased in the year 2019.
